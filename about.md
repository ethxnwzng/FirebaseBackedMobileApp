GamerBlog is a blogging app for video game players. The app requires that users be signed in to both view and write posts. Users can either sign in or sign up once the app is opened, once succesful, they will be taken to the homespage. On the homepage, a list of the most recent articles published by other users on the app will be on display. These articles can all be clicked on for users to be taken to a more detailed view that displays: the article title, username of the author that wrote the article, the game associated with the article (if there is one), the date the article was posted, the actual article itself, and any links that the author may have included within their post. Back on the homescreen, there's four buttons on the top of the screen (from right to left): the rightmost allows users to sign out of their account and be taken back to the sign in screen where they can change accounts or make a new one, the one to the right allows users to write their own articles (and be able to modify all the variables stated previously that users see once they click on an article), the next button allows users to modify the search results of the app (by number of results, most recent, oldest, most words in body, and least words in body), and lastly the final button allows users to modify their own profile by changing their username. Below those four buttons also exists a search bar where users can search for articles and recieve results based on which article's titles matches their search text. 

Added features:
User meta data -> all users can create a username and create posts under that name (once a user is signed in, but this can be easily changed by clicking on the profile button and inputting a username. the app knows when users do not have a username yet)
Links -> once writing an article, users have the option of adding as many links as they want to be displayed to other users that view their posts. users viewing posts can click on these links to be redirected to them.
Searching and search modifers -> users can customize their search results by clicking on the search modifers button, where they can customize the number of articles shown and sort them by different variables. users can also search for articles by their titles within the search bar
Users being able to see the usernames for the authors of articles -> every article written and posted within the app will show the username of the author (if they have one)
Custom signing in and signing up -> did not make Firebase take over my signing in UI but did it myself through the SignInView
Game field when creating and viewing articles -> since this is a blogging app for gamers, users can specify the kind of game they are writing a post about so other users viewing their posts can know
